### ProductsApp

ProductsApp is an Android application that allows users to view a list of products fetched from an API. The app consists of two screens: the main screen with a button to view products and the secondary screen displaying the list of products with a structured layout.

#### Key Features:
- **Two-Screen Navigation:** Users can navigate between the main screen and the product list screen using intuitive buttons.
- **API Integration:** The app fetches product data from a RESTful API (https://dummyjson.com/products) using Retrofit.
- **RecyclerView with Multiple View Types:** The product list screen features a RecyclerView with two types of items: a title text ("Products List") and a list of product items.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Implements a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebase.
- **Proper Code Quality:** Emphasizes best practices for Android development, including proper error handling, asynchronous data fetching, and adherence to coding standards.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Kotlin:** Developed entirely in Kotlin programming language for modern Android development.
- **Retrofit:** Used to handle API calls and data retrieval in a robust and efficient manner.
- **RecyclerView:** Utilized to display dynamic lists of products with varying view types.
- **LiveData and ViewModel:** Implements Android Jetpack's LiveData and ViewModel components for data observation and lifecycle management.
